Paths we investigated: 

- Using streamlite versus dash for creating the webapp using python

- Whether to use some python library, leaflet.js, plotly.js, or plot.ly (python) to code map interactivity features


Currently we're using plotly and dash. See `dash_plotly_map.py` for an example plotting FARS 2020 crash data. The example in this file is based on this [example code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71375339/plotly-mapbox-get-the-geometry-of-current-view-zoom-level).  


We are using openstreetmaps data and mapbox to display the openstreetmap data for the map's base layer.
