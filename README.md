Paths we investigated: 

- Using streamlit versus dash versus flask for creating the webapp using python

- Whether to use some python library, leaflet.js, plotly.js, or plot.ly (python) to code map interactivity features


We've decided to use leaflet and flask to allow the greatest customizability and interactivity. We are using OpenStreetMap for the map's base layer.  


See the `hin_app` folder for an example plotting FARS 2020 crash data, an example heatmap, and boundaries for U.S. states, counties, and Metropolitan Planning Organizations.
